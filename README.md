# Quality README Generator

## Description

This project was created in order to accelerate the process of creating a professional quality README file. User input will be taken directly from the command line and turned into a README file with sections corresponding to the command line prompts. During development, I learned how to use nodejs and inquirer in order to create a useful program that can be run with nothing but a console and javascript files.

## Installation

Simply clone or copy the repository into a local system, from there you can run the program and generate a professional README

## Usage

Open the console of your system or Git Bash, and navigate to the folder containing the program. Navigate into the "utils" folder and type "node index" into the command line. Follow the prompts, entering the information you would like to be added to your README file. A confirmation log will appear when the file has been successfully created. Your new README file can be found within the local copy of the repository titled "generatedREADME.md". Below is a link to a walkthrough of the workflow.
